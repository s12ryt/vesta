Vesta is a configurable Windows x64 project with combat assistance, a complete
visual system, movement tools, grenade lineups, an in-game radar, and a
sandboxed Lua API. The native client stays external: no injection and no driver.

## Quick start

1. Download [`vesta.exe`](https://github.com/Read1dno/vesta/releases/latest).
2. Start Counter-Strike 2.
3. Run `vesta.exe`.
4. Press `Insert` to open the menu. Press `End` to close Vesta.

That is all you need. Profiles are managed from **Misc → Configs**. On a compact
keyboard, change the menu and exit keys in `%TEMP%\vesta\hotkeys.cfg`, then
restart Vesta.

## Important

> [!CAUTION]
> **Lua scripts.** Never run an unreviewed Lua script: it may be harmful. Vetted,
> popular scripts will be published in this repository and on the Vesta website.

> [!TIP]
> **Performance.** An external overlay shares CPU and GPU resources with the
> game. If ESP appears delayed or the overlay FPS is low, select the **Fullscreen**
> render mode and set model, texture, shader, and particle detail to Low in CS2.

> [!WARNING]
> **VACnet / VAC Live — 24 September 2026.** Current reports indicate that
> Aimbot, RCS and Triggerbot use can be detected and can cause a cooldown.
> No FPS setting, play style or feature configuration guarantees protection.
> The reliable way to avoid a cheat-related cooldown is not to play with cheats.
> Vesta does not promise immunity from cooldowns or bans.
